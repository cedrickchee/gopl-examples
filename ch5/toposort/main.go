The output of the `toposort` program is shown below. It is deterministic, an
often-desirable property that doesnâ€™t always come for free. Here, the values of
the prereqs map are slices, not more maps, so their iteration order is
deterministic, and we sor ted the keys of prereqs before making the initial
calls to visitAll.

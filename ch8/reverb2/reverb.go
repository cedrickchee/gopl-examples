Now the echoes are concurrent and overlap in time.

In the session below, the client’s input is left-aligned and the server’s
responses are indented. The client shouts at the echo server three times:

$ go build gopl.io/ch8/reverb2
$ ./reverb2 &
$ ./netcat2
Is there anybody there?
    IS THERE ANYBODY THERE?
Yooo-hooo!

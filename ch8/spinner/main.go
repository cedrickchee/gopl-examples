After several seconds of animation, the fib(45) call returns and the main
function prints its result:

$ go run gopl.io/ch8/spinner
Fibonacci(45) = 1134903170
*/

// The `main` function then returns. When this happens, all goroutines are
// abruptly terminated and the program exits. Other than by returning from
// `main` or exiting the program, there is no programmatic way for one goroutine
// to stop another, but as we will see later, there are ways to communicate with
// a goroutine to request that it stop itself.
//
// Notice how the program is expressed as the composition of two autonomous
// activities, spinning and Fibonacci computation. Each is written as a separate
// function but both make progress concurrently.
